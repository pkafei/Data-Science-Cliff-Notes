### Data Science Code School

Data science is considered the sexiest job, but very few code schools are teaching the skills you need. The Humanities Hacking Academy will give you the skills you need to:

* access open data
* learn the most efficient tricks in cleaning data
* visualize your data like a boss
* learn how to conduct statistical analysis

If you interested in our next class or your company would like to book a half-day seminar, please get in [touch](plbanalyze@gmail.com).
